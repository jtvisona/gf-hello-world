# Welcome to the GF Hello World
## The Unofficial Grammatical Framework Introductory Tutorial

This repo is the home of an unofficial tutorial site for learning how to use the [Grammatical Framework (Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grammatical_Framework_(programming_language)), a Haskell-based project
that allows for the construction of formal grammars. Think of GF as a programming language to capture the syntax and semantics of natural languages (NL) for machine execution. The tutorials contained by this site will
presume a minimum of knowledge of both linguistic and programming essentials. While GF is a sophisticated tool for processing NL in use around the world by doctoral students and post-docs, with the bare
minimum of knowledge, anyone can get the system up and running and experiment with the intersectionality between natural and [formal grammars <Wikipedia>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_grammar) as part as an
introduction into [natural language processing (NLP) <Wikipedia>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing).

## Sources of Truth

There are a number of places you can find more information on grammatical framework. The following list is a short-list of very important sources of information:

- The Grammatical Framework website found at [https://www.grammaticalframework.org/](https://www.grammaticalframework.org/).
- A more interactive way to obtain information is through both [IRC](https://web.libera.chat/?channels=#gf) and [Discord](https://discord.gg/EvfUsjzmaz).
- There's a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/gf-dev).
- You can search for GF related questions using [Stack Overflow's 'gf' tag](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/gf).
- The [GitHub repo](https://github.com/GrammaticalFramework/), of course.
- And for those with the need for specialized attention for projects like those in the corporate world, [Dr. Arne Ranta](https://www.cse.chalmers.se/~aarne/) and his colleagues consult through their organization, [Digital Grammars](https://www.digitalgrammars.com/).

## Presumptions

GF is a sophisticated tool for accomplishing a sophisticated task. It's primary purpose is to help with accurate translations between natural languages by using a strategy of building an abstract syntax tree
that allows syntax in one NL, like English, to be rapidly translated to another NL, such as German, by using an abstract formal grammar. Thus 'Good day' is mapped to 'Guten Tag' through the use of GF programming language
that allows one to quickly craft an [abstract syntax tree (AST) <WP>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abstract_syntax_tree). ASTs are one form of semantic representation that a
[compiler <WP>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compiler) can be used to build software to rapidly and accurately translate langauges. This sort of technology can be quite heady. In fact, GF is adjacent to topics
such as:

- **Set theory** - the mathematical theory that describes collections and elements that are their members
- **Type theory** - the description of collection by assigning them type theory 
- **Intuitionistic logic** - a non-classical logic that doesn't use certain rules like double negation
- **Type-theoretical semantics** - a meta-theory of semantics that builds on type theory and intuitionstic logic
- **Programming language and compiler theory** - computer science theories on building programming language and compilers/interpreters to process them
- **Grammar theory** - a computer science topic that looks at grammars, languages, and finte automata 
- **NL grammars and linguistics** - the study of langauges through the lens of the traditional non-computational approaches to langauges like English, German, Japanese, etc.

Because these topics are highly advanced academic matters when covered with full rigor, they can be discouraging in trying to understand how to use GF. The purpose of this repo is to provide an descriptive introduction
into the tool as an in-road into a more sophisticated understanding. Therefore, these tutors will come with a fair amount of exposition and references to materials to enrich understanding. As a GF user gets more
comfortable with a framework, it will become easier to use the sources of truth above to find information. At a minimum, a participant in this site should have some basic linguistic and computer science knowledge, such
as the ability to diagram a sentence and a familiarity with grammatical terms one might see in an advanced English class in high school and the basic knowledge on how to download, install software, tweak system and IDE
settings, and have the ability to execute scripts.
